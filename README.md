The Specification describes a design for dynamically establishing and verifying trust in the components in a server. Until this document, servers had no standardized, open, and automated mechanism to dynamically establish and verify trust in those products. For example, does a network adapter still contain the initial firmware that was installed by its manufacturer? Has the latest security patch been applied to the firmware in a memory controller? Which countryâ€™s certified cryptographic algorithms are implemented in a storage unit? Cloud service providers cannot rely on procurement agreements alone to assure that the products they buy are secure. These products must be protected during design, development, manufacture, testing, shipping, provisioning, installation, and operation.
This specification will address requirements for dynamically establishing and verifying trust in the components in a server.
